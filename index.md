# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how the Radio FM application ("we", "our", or "the app") handles user information.

## Information Collection and Use

Radio FM does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.

The app only streams publicly available radio stations through an internet connection. We do not require users to create accounts or provide personal data.

## Log Data

In case of app errors, basic technical information such as device model, Android version, and error logs may be generated automatically by the operating system. This information is used solely for app stability and improvement.

## Cookies

Radio FM does not use cookies.

## Third-Party Services

The app may connect to third-party radio streaming servers to play audio content. These services operate independently and have their own privacy policies.

Radio FM does not control or store data handled by third-party radio providers.

## Children’s Privacy

Radio FM is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

If you believe that a child has provided personal information through the app, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.

## Security

We value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect user data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.
